# ML-for-Equivalent-Damping-Ratio
This repository includes: 
- The MATLAB codes needed to execute an ML-based algorithm for estimating the equivalent damping ratio of rectangular RC shear walls at 1% drift ratio. 
- A database (DatabaseV01.xlsx) including detailed specifications of 161 RC shear walls used for training and testing the ML-based algorithm.
- The bibliography of the database references (DataBase_References.pdf).
- To execute the algorithm: a) After downloading the files of MATLABCodes folder, open the file (MainCodeEDR.m) in MATLAB b) In the opened file, set the file directory as current (cd) c) Run the file
